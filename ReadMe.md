**A code Review**

**Description :** File deletion with parameter filepath and creation date

I created this project in order to answer my application test as a .Net programmer,

I created this with Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64 bit),

and using dot net frame work 6.0, with c# as the main language here.

why? because it is the latest version that I could get, and the community version is free to download


the challenge with this solution is when I tried to open this solution in another computer

that has vs 2019 only (then I installed the vs 2022) because vs 2019 doesn't support .net framework 6.0

I might be wrong, but when I use the vs 2022 (newly installed) it works again like charm.


**How to install?**

if you just want to use the program, then find the exe files inside this bin\Debug\net6.0\ folder.

**How to use this project?**

simple I will tell you with a diagram so you know what this code do:

![Test Image 1](Drawing1.jpg)

it should work, otherwise you will need to install .net framework 6.0 in your computer.

look here:

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

you should choose your OS and your type of processor (arm/x64/x86)
