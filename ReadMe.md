**A code Review**

**Description :** a conversion from number to words in c#

I created this project in order to answer my application test as a .Net programmer,

I created this with Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64 bit),

and using dot net frame work 6.0, with c# as the main language here.

why? because it is the latest version that I could get, and the community version is free to download


the challenge with this solution is not too compatible with the older version of visual studio


**How to install?**

if you just want to use the program, then find the exe files inside this bin\Debug\net6.0\ folder.

**How to use this project?**

please input you desired number with format:[$][number][.][cents]
and it will tell you in English how you should read them.
there are some restriction like:
1. you cannot put any alphabet character (of course)
2. the length of the string is limited by 15 chars(s)

![Test Image 1](screenshot.jpg)

it should work, otherwise you will need to install .net framework 6.0 in your computer.

look here:

you should choose your OS and your type of processor (arm/x64/x86)
